# Practical 3
Machine Learning, spring 2015

## Setup
Setup will be the same as last time in practical 1. Please refer to the [practical 1 repository](https://github.com/oxford-cs-ml-2015/practical1), and run the script as instructed last time.

We will use the Torch package `gnuplot` for plotting; you may use (advanced: recommended to try at home instead or if you have time afterwards) iTorch instead as the script installs it.

## Materials
See `simple_example.lua` for the example mentioned in the "Introduction" part of the writeup, and `practical3.lua` for the template for the primary task.
